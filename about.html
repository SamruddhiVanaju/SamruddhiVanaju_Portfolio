        My journey into the world of software development began with a simple curiosity about how things work. 
    This curiosity quickly evolved into a passion for building and creating, leading me to pursue a career in Information Technology.<br>
    Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a deep appreciation for the art and science of coding. Each project I take on is an opportunity to learn something new and to apply my skills in innovative ways. 
    I invite you to explore my portfolio and see how my passion for technology translates into impactful software solutions.
